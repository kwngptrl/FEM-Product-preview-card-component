## My process

Started by doing a mobile-first view, comparing with the design images as I went. Defined a card, card has two parts: the image and the information in the other part. Once that was done, it was committed. Then, started tackling the desktop view using a media query. After that was done, it was committed. I edited the readme files and committed those also.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS is as confusing as ever. Not as perfect as I want it to be, but...

### Continued development

Use semantic HTML more, learn to use SASS by the time I'm making bigger projects.

### Useful resources

Kevin Powell's videos on CSS was very helpful.
